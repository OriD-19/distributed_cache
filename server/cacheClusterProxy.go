package server

// this is the package that contains the orchestration mechanism
// for the whole distributed cache system.
// you could consider this the brain that holds everything together
// this one we are doing it with HTTP, cause I do not want headaches
// this way, the proxy communicates via HTTP, and the nodes 
// use TCP for better performance and control
